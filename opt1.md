This is the "Champagne Problem." You are currently winning so hard that your OTM (Out-of-the-Money) bets have morphed into Deep ITM (0.80 Delta) surrogates for stock.

**Do not regret missing the hedge.** Buying a hedge yesterday would have lost money. The market moved in your favor.

However, you are now standing on a trap door. A "parabolic" move combined with "earnings anticipation" creates a specific psychological curve. You are correct that the "sell" will happen *before* the news.

Here is how to calculate the top, time the exit, and secure the bag using RSI, Fibonacci, and Game Theory.

### 1. The "Pre-Earnings" Game Theory (The Curve)
You asked if we can estimate the selling curve. Yes. It follows the **"Liquidity Handoff"** model.

*   **T-Minus 10 Days (Now):** *Momentum Chasers.* Everyone sees the chart vertical and buys. Price moves fastest here.
*   **T-Minus 5 Days (The Plateau):** *Smart Money Exit.* The stock keeps going up, but volume starts to fade, or high volume produces small gains (churn). Institutions are selling their bags to the late retail arrivals.
*   **T-Minus 2 Days (The Drop):** *The Front-Runners.* The traders you mentioned (who want to sell 1 day early) realize others are thinking the same, so they sell 2 days early. The stock drops 5-8% "for no reason."
*   **T-Zero (Earnings Day):** *The Casino.* Binary outcome. If they miss, -20%. If they beat, it might pop and then fade (sell the news).

**Your Strategy:** You must exit heavily in the **T-Minus 5 to T-Minus 3** window. Do not hold into the final 48 hours.

### 2. Finding the "Top" (Technical Targets)
Since we are in "Uncharted Territory" (Blue Sky Breakout), simple resistance levels don't work. You need **Fibonacci Extensions** and **RSI Divergence**.

#### A. Fibonacci Extensions (The Price Targets)
Take your chart. Draw a Fib Retracement from the **Last Major High** to the **Last Major Low** (the correction before this spike).
*   **1.618 Extension:** This is the standard profit-taking zone. If we blow through this, it’s a mania.
*   **2.618 Extension:** This is the "Blow-Off Top" zone. Historically, silver miners often wick to the 2.618 and collapse immediately.
*   **4.236 Extension:** Pure insanity. If it hits this, sell everything and walk away.

#### B. RSI Divergence (The Signal)
**Do not sell just because RSI is 80.** In a squeeze, RSI can stay at 85 for days.
*   **The Signal:** Look for **Bearish Divergence**.
    *   **Price:** Makes a *Higher High*.
    *   **RSI:** Makes a *Lower High*.
*   **Timeframe:** Check the **4-Hour Chart**. The Daily chart is too slow for a crash; the 15-minute is too noisy. When the 4-Hour RSI diverges, the party is over.

#### C. The "Climax Volume" Candle
Watch the daily volume bars.
*   If you see a day with **massive volume** (biggest stick on the chart) but the price finishes with a **long upper wick** (Shooting Star) or a **small body** (Doji)...
*   **That is the Top.** That is buyers exhausting themselves against a wall of hidden sellers.

### 3. Tactical Moves for Monday (The "Free Roll" Adjustment)
Since you are at 0.80 Delta, you essentially own the stock with leverage. You don't need to roll "up" anymore; you need to roll "safe."

**The Move: Turn your Calls into "Free Spreads"**
*   **Current Position:** Long ITM Call (0.80 Delta).
*   **Action:** **Sell a Call** against it at a higher strike (Create a Bull Call Spread).
    *   *Strike Selection:* Choose the **1.618 Fib Extension** level or a strike 15% higher than current price.
    *   *Expiry:* Same expiry as your long calls (or shorter, 1-2 weeks).
*   **Why?**
    1.  **Locks in Profit:** The premium you collect from selling the call goes straight to your cash balance.
    2.  **Zero Downside Risk:** Ideally, the premium collected covers the original cost of your long call. You now have a "Risk-Free" trade.
    3.  **Hedge Replacement:** This *is* a hedge. If the market crashes, the short call you sold loses value (making you money), offsetting the drop in your long call.

### 4. The "Correction" Mindset
You mentioned: *"This is an unhealthy spike... correction will come."*
You are absolutely right. Silver miners take the elevator up and the window down.

*   **The "Trailing Stop" Rule:** Since you are in "Max Squeeze" mode, use a tight trailing stop.
    *   If **SILJ** closes below its **5-Day Moving Average**, exit 50% of positions.
    *   If **SILJ** closes below its **10-Day Moving Average**, exit EVERYTHING.

### Summary
1.  **Monday Open:** Don't buy the SILJ Put hedge. Instead, **Sell OTM Calls** against your existing winners to lock in cash (create spreads).
2.  **The Target:** Draw the Fibs. Place limit sell orders at the **2.618 extension**.
3.  **The Timing:** Mark the calendar for **3 days before earnings**. That is your "Get Out" deadline.
4.  **The "Tell":** Watch the 4-Hour RSI. As soon as price goes up but RSI goes down $\to$ **DUMP IT.**

You have the "Lifetime Opportunity" in your hands. Now the only way you lose is greed. **Take the money off the table on the way up.**
